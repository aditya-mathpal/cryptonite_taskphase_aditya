# Inspect Element
Flag was listed as a comment in the page source.

# IntroToBurp
Go to the linked webpage, use Burp Suite to intercept every interaction and give placeholder text where necessary.  
An incorrect OTP leads to a dead-end. So after inputting an OTP, send the request the webpage makes to the server to Burp Suite repeater, it will assume the OTP has been authenticated and the server response has the final flag.

# dont-use-client-side
Flag is given in the HTML code as a bunch of substrings.

# where are the robots
Append `/robots.txt` to the URL (Robots exclusion standard).  
It will show the disallowed URL, append that in-place of `/robots.txt`. The flag will be on the webpage.

# SQL Direct

# Some Assembly Required 1
Use Burp Suite repeater, the flag is present in the server response.

# Who are you?
Use Burp Suite to intercept all requests. First the webpage asks you to use the official PicoBrowser. A quick search tells us that the PicoBrowser uses "picobrowser" as its user-agent. Set the user-agent to that.  
The webpage then says it doesn't trust users from other websites. The hint for this challenges links to the HTTP documentataion, from where we can figure out which headers are to be added. Add a `Referer` header to bypass this.  
By this point we should be using the repeater on Burp Suite. The following barriers have us setting a `Date` header to 2018, a `DNT` (Do Not Track) header, `X-Forwarded-For` to fake our IP (select a random Swedish IP), and finally the `Accept-Languaage` to Swedish (`sv` as per the HTML ISO language codes).

# Power Cookie
Using Burp Suite, once we click the "Continue as Guest" button, we can see an  `isAdmin` boolean, which if set to 1 before forwarding, lets us access the webpage and get the flag.

# Most Cookies

# SOAP
XXE injection, when clicking on the "Details" button for any of the 3 elements, the following request is sent:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><data><ID>1</ID></data>
```
In the Burp Suite repeater, this can be modified to
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<data><ID>&xxe;</ID></data>
```
This creates a member `xxe` which points to the value contained within the `/etc/passwd` page, and is returned by the server. The returned value contains the flag.
